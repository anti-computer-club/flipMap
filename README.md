# About

This is the APK repository for **FlipMap, the Map App for Flip Phones!**

FlipMap is intended to provide personal navigation services on any reasonably-modern Android-based 'dumb' phone. It's intended to be usable with slower devices that lack touchscreens or full keyboards, and does not even require an account! FlipMap is powered by OpenStreetMap-based services such as Komoot's Photon and OpenRouteService, all brokered through our [backend component](https://github.com/anti-computer-club/flipmap-backend).

For more information, see our [project website.](https://anticomputer.club/)
