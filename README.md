# About

FlipMap is intended to provide navigation to Android-based 'dumb' phones. It's intended to be usable with slower devices that lack touchscreens or full keyboards. FlipMap is powered by OpenStreetMap-based services - currently Komoot's Photon and OpenRouteService, because those were the first ones I found.\

The backend is currently down, but should be up some time in August once I'm moved out of the woods.
