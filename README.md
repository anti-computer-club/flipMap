# About

This is the APK repository for **FlipMap, the Map App for Flip Phones!**

FlipMap is intended to provide personal navigation services on any reasonably-modern Android-based 'dumb' phone. It's intended to be usable with slower devices that lack touchscreens or full keyboards, and does not even require an account! FlipMap is powered by OpenStreetMap-based services such as Komoot's Photon and OpenRouteService, all brokered through our [backend component](https://github.com/anti-computer-club/flipmap-backend).

For more information, see our [project website.](https://anticomputer.club/)

1. Download the APK from the [releases](https://github.com/anti-computer-club/flipMap/releases) page
2. Install the APK however you prefer
    * Not all flip phones support third-party APK installation
3. You're ready!
    * Use the softkeys (the top left/right keys on your phone) to trigger the left/right navbar items
    * Use `*` and `#` to zoom out/in.
    * Use the directional pad to pan the map
    * Use 1/2/3 to select a route after searching

If things aren't working as documented, feel free to file an issue!
